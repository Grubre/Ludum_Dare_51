## Building the project
To build the project you run the `./scripts/build.sh` script with build configurations as arguments.\
For example, by running `./scripts/build.sh Release Debug` you will build both the `Release` configuration and the `Debug` configuration.
Currently supported build configurations are: `{Debug, Release}`.
## Running the executable
You can run the executable with the `./scripts/run.sh` script. You have to pass one argument to the script - the build configuration that is supposed to be ran. For example `./scripts/run.sh Debug` will run the `Debug` configuration.
